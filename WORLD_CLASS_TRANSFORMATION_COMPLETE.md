# 🎯 FINAL CLEANUP: MEGA MENU & FOOTER REMOVED

I have performed a deep cleanup of your header and footer to remove all irrelevant "placeholder" content and focus entirely on your app's actual features.

## 📦 UPLOAD THESE FILES TO FINALIZE THE LOOK:

### **1. Header & Navigation (Fixes Mega Menu)**
- 🚀 **`includes/header.php`** → Upload to `/public_html/includes/`
    - Removed the "Mega Menu" hover panel.
    - Updated navigation to: **Shop, Money Transfer, Logistics, Procurement**.

### **2. Footer (Removes Awards & NYC Address)**
- 🚀 **`includes/premium-footer.php`** → Upload to `/public_html/includes/`
    - Removed "BEST ONLINE SHOP Newsweek 2023".
    - Removed "BBB ACCREDITED BUSINESS A+".
    - Removed "420 9th Ave, New York, NY 10001".
    - Updated columns to match your project services.

### **3. Mobile Optimization (The Dashboard Fix)**
- 🚀 **`assets/css/mobile-first-optimization.css`** → Upload to `/public_html/assets/css/`
    - Shrinks Dashboard stats (GHS numbers) to a premium **16px**.
    - Fixed sidebar height so it doesn't overlap the bottom menu.
