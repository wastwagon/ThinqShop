## 💡 Recommendation

Given the file size and remaining work, I recommend:

**Option 1:** Continue systematically (thorough, 3 hours)
- Clean every section methodically
- Ensure nothing is missed
- Most reliable

**Option 2:** Focus on critical visible sections (faster, 1 hour)
- Product cards (most visible)
- Hero section (first impression)
- Navigation (already mostly done)
- Skip less visible components

**Option 3:** Hybrid approach (balanced, 1.5 hours)
- Continue systematic for critical sections
- Quick pass for remaining sections
- Manual review of key pages
